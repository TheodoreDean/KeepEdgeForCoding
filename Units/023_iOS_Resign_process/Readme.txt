### Re-sign IPA file and install on an unjailbreaked iPhone ###

### The whole idea it to change the signature file in the IPA, then resign it with developer provision file or paid developer file ###


#### Procedure ####

> 1. Download the iOS app signer from github
```
https://github.com/DanTheMan827/ios-app-signer
```
Execute it by Xcode on Mac and get ready to resign it. 

> 2. subsitute the embedded.mobileprovision in the original IPA file following the guidance as below
[https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/]

This file can also be find in the root folder, please be aware it only work for my developer accounts and registered device. (e.g., iPhone8+)

> 3. Install it on your iPhone by Xcode->Windows->device->+ Or using iTools.  

May the luck be with you.
